This directory contains the files needed to build glibc for the Debian
GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd distributions.

To build this package, you'll need this `debian' directory, and
`glibc-VERSION.tar.gz', and `glibc-linuxthreads-LTVERSION.tar.gz' (the
VERSIONS need not match). Put them all in a directory called
`glibc-VERSION', and make sure that the `debian/rules', `debian/changelog',
and `debian/sysdeps/config.mk' refer correctly to VERSION.  Then, you can
run dpkg-buildpackage, which will automatically unpack the tarballs, and
start the build.

Compiling the GNU C library yourself requires a lot of resources.  For
a complete build using dpkg-buildpackage you need at least 200MB free
disk space and at least 16MB of RAM and 32MB of swap space (if you
have only that much you're better off not running X at the same
time). Note that the C library on the Hurd is also somewhat larger:
you'll need over 800MB of free disk space to build Hurdish packages.

A complete build runs for about 6 hours on a 486-133 and still just
about 3 hours on a Pentium 133. The cause for this is the intricate
Makefile structure of glibc which needs a lot of computing power for
make to figure out the automatically generated dependencies.

For Linux, you will need at least the kernel-headers for the specific
kernel version required for your machine's architecture. These are
specified in the `debian/sysdeps/linux.mk' file, and can be overridden
by exporting the environment variable LINUX_SOURCE set to the path to
the desired kernel.

For the Hurd, you will need to have installed the GNU Mach and Hurd
header files (which come with the `gnumach-dev' and `hurd-dev'
packages).  See the Hurd source package's `INSTALL' file for more
information.

It is suggested that you also read the `README' and `INSTALL' files in
the top-level of the glibc source tree.
