General:
- generate debhelper files per libc version
  Note that this needs to split things into -opt packages based
  on GLIBC_PASSES with the exception of nptl which is special-cased.
- update changelog
  Specifically: Update dpatch, use debhelper, use nptl, breakout sysdeps
  Essentially rewrite the rules file, move all files we provide
  into debian/local Remove dependancy of kernel-headers-foo

- usr/include/asm, usr/include/linux
