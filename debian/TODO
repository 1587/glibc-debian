General:
- generate debhelper files per libc version
  Note that this needs to split things into -opt packages based
  on GLIBC_PASSES with the exception of nptl which is special-cased.
- update changelog
  Specifically: Update dpatch, use debhelper, use nptl, breakout sysdeps
  Essentially rewrite the rules file, move all files we provide
  into debian/local Remove dependancy of kernel-headers-foo
  Make sure to specifically mention: Jeff Bailey, Branden Robinson, Daniel
  Jacobowitz

gotom doesn't like local directory, prefers is still broken down by package.

Add debhelper dependency

Test all the $(GLIBC_PASSES)_MIN_KERNEL_VERSION and such to make sure that we're compiling with at least that kernel version.  Otherwise some things may fail

libc-dev:
- usr/include/asm, usr/include/linux

libc-prof, libc-udeb:
- Create the packages. =)

glibc-doc:
- HTML docs
- /usr/share/doc-base/glibc-manual

Build nptl packages for i686 instead of i486
Check what headers we need to install for nptl.
Only add some libraries to the optimized packages and to /lib/tls?

Re-add disabled dpatches.
