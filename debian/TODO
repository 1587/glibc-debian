General:
- generate debhelper files per libc version
  Note that this needs to split things into -opt packages based
  on GLIBC_PASSES with the exception of nptl which is special-cased.
- update changelog
  Specifically: Update dpatch, use debhelper, use nptl, breakout sysdeps
  Essentially rewrite the rules file, move all files we provide
  into debian/local Remove dependancy of kernel-headers-foo

gotom doesn't like local directory, prefers is still broken down by package.

Add debhelper dependency

Test all the $(GLIBC_PASSES)_MIN_KERNEL_VERSION and such to make sure that we're compiling with at least that kernel version.  Otherwise some things may fail

Build nptl packages for i686 instead of i486
Check what headers we need to install for nptl.
Only add some libraries to the optimized packages and to /lib/tls, instead
of all of them?

Re-add disabled dpatches.

The i386 vs. i686 libraries patch (HP_TIMING) is not correct.  The timers
need to be either initialized in libc.so's initializer instead, or else
ld.so needs to do cpu detection and conditionally initialize them.

Other architecture builds.

Before it leaves experimental, verify the contents of every package on every
architecture against unstable to make sure we didn't lose files.
