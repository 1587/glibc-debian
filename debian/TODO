General:
- generate debhelper files per libc version
  Note that this needs to split things into -opt packages based
  on GLIBC_PASSES with the exception of nptl which is special-cased.
- update changelog
  Specifically: Update dpatch, use debhelper, use nptl, breakout sysdeps
  Essentially rewrite the rules file, move all files we provide
  into debian/local Remove dependancy of kernel-headers-foo
- resurrect udeb handling

libc-dev:
- usr/include/asm, usr/include/linux

libc:
- preinst, postinst, prerm, postrm
- drow says nptl can safely be i686 only for now, since the implementation
  is completely separate and will satisfy most people.

glibc-doc:
- preinst, postinst, prerm, postrm
- HTML docs
- /usr/share/doc-base/glibc-manual
  
nscd:
- preinst, postinst, prerm, postrm

locales:
- preinst, postinst, prerm, postrm
- debconf
