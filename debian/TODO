Outstanding concerns
====================

  - gotom doesn't like local directory, prefers is still broken down by
    package.

TODO
====

* General:

 - Test all the $(GLIBC_PASSES)_MIN_KERNEL_VERSION and such to make 
   sure that we're compiling with at least that kernel version. 
   Otherwise some things may fail

 - Before it leaves experimental, verify:
   1) the file list of every package
   2) the control information (dependencies etc.)
   3) the shlibs files

   on every architecture against unstable to make sure we didn't lose
   anything we didn't want to lose.

 - Make sure that prep.sh and version aren't in the root of the source
   package.

* libc:
 - Only add some libraries to the optimized packages and to /lib/tls,
   instead of all of them?
 - Add patch to display linux-gate.so.1 in ldd.
 - Check dpkg-shlibdeps for linux-gate.so.1 handling.
 - Some documentation missing from libc6 package
 - Don't do make install for libc6-i686 if we aren't going to use the
   results - it's very slow.  We may need to make install for nptl to
   get the few headers that differ.

* libc-dev:

 - What do we do for headers on 32/64 systems?  Do we generate
   #if wrappers for /usr/include?  This looks like a non-issue since
   only asm needs it.
 - libc6-dev dependency on matching libc6
 - -dev support for library variants like nptl?  64-bit libraries are
   covered.
