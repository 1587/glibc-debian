Outstanding concerns
====================

  - gotom doesn't like local directory, prefers is still broken down by
    package.

TODO
====

* General:

 - Make sure that prep.sh and version aren't in the root of the source
   package.

* libc:
 - Only add some libraries to the optimized packages and to /lib/tls,
   instead of all of them?
 - Add patch to display (or ignore) linux-gate.so.1 in ldd.
 - Check dpkg-shlibdeps for linux-gate.so.1 handling.
 - Don't do make install for libc6-i686 if we aren't going to use the
   results - it's very slow.  We may need to make install for nptl to
   get the few headers that differ.

* libc-dev:

 - What do we do for headers on 32/64 systems?  Do we generate
   #if wrappers for /usr/include?  This looks like a non-issue since
   only asm needs it.
 - -dev support for library variants like nptl?  64-bit libraries are
   covered.
