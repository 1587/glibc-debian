Outstanding concerns
====================

  - gotom doesn't like local directory, prefers is still broken down by
    package.

TODO
====

* General:

 - Before it leaves experimental, verify:
   1) the file list of every package
   2) the control information (dependencies etc.)
   3) the shlibs files
   4) the other contents of DEBIAN/

   on every architecture against unstable to make sure we didn't lose
   anything we didn't want to lose.

   As of 2003-10-26 22:06:00 GMT, all of these are OK on i386.

 - Make sure that prep.sh and version aren't in the root of the source
   package.

* libc:
 - Only add some libraries to the optimized packages and to /lib/tls,
   instead of all of them?
 - Add patch to display (or ignore) linux-gate.so.1 in ldd.
 - Check dpkg-shlibdeps for linux-gate.so.1 handling.
 - Don't do make install for libc6-i686 if we aren't going to use the
   results - it's very slow.  We may need to make install for nptl to
   get the few headers that differ.

* libc-dev:

 - What do we do for headers on 32/64 systems?  Do we generate
   #if wrappers for /usr/include?  This looks like a non-issue since
   only asm needs it.
 - -dev support for library variants like nptl?  64-bit libraries are
   covered.
